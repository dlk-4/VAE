Final project for GRA4152 - Object Oriented Programming with Python

1. Every files should be in the same directory.

2. To read this docstring, use Python’s built-in help system:
    * help(MODULE_NAME)
    * python -c "import MODULE_NAME; help(MODULE_NAME)"
    * pydoc MODULE_NAME

3. When it comes to the doc string for this project, I followed the “CashRegister” class doc string format (Lecture, Oct 30).

4. For 3 visualization options, user can have PDF files in the same directroy where "train_vae.py is executed.
